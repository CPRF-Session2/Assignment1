1. A compiler helps the computer understand code by processing a piece of code written in a specific language to another language that the computer can understand. In this case, we program the code first in C. Then, the compiler takes the code in C and converts it into instructions readable by the computer. 
2a.  It is a compilation error. The statement is missing a semicolon, which would mean the code would not compile. 
2b. It is a compilation error. The statement has a variable starting with a number, when a variable must start with a letter. 
2c. It is a runtime error. The number four cannot be divided by 0, resulting in code that cannot be carried out, even though it could be successfully compiled and start executing. 
3. The code says the value of x should be %d, even though it should be %f since the printing variable is a floating point. %d is for printing integers instead. In addition, it seems that return is written with a capital R instead of lowercase. I belive that would result in a runtime error, because the code would most likely be able to compile. Also, it says "void" before main, even though that means the computer does not have to return anything, yet it's still asking for a return.
