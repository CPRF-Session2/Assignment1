 1) What is a compiler?
    
A compiler converts code in one language into another language. Our compiler (gcc) converts C into assembly.
	 
2)
	a) this is a compile time error because it is missing a semicolon and does not have correct syntax
	b) this is a compile time error because the variable starts with a number
	c) this is runtime error because you cannot divide by zero
	A compile time error is a error, usually syntax related, that makes the code unreadble to the     compiler. Where as with a runtime error, your code compiles but the code cannot be executed.
		  
3) In line 2, the word "void" should be replaced with "int". In line 4, the %d should be %f.
