1. A compiler is a program that takes code written in C and translates it into Assembly, a compiler is used so a computer can be one step closer to reading code



2.

a: compiler error-it is syntaxual they forgot the ";"

b: compiler error - again sytax error - you cant begin with a non alphabetic character


c: runtime error - nothing is wrong here technically but the computer cannot divide by 0


Compiler errors are human caused while runtime errors are the limitations of the computer

3. A couple things wrong with this code in the printf it does %d which works for int not float it should %f and they captalized the "r" in return while it should stay lowercase. Finally int main() rather than void main(), which almost got by me because void is what I use in processing.js all the time.
