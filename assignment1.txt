1. Compiler is a program which translates codes written 
in different programming languages to a code that the machine 
can understand and process.
2.A. int x = 2 Compilation Error, There is no semicolon at the end.
2.B. float 1num = 3.0; Compilation Error, The name of the float cannot start with a number.
2.C. double num = 4.0 / 0.0; Runtime Error, It cannot divide 4 by 0
2. Compilation Error occurs when there is a syntax error, a typo. Runtime   Error occurs after compilation, the code is grammatically correct but it    cannot be exacuted
3.
include <stdio.h>

void main() {
	float x = 41.5;
	printf("The value of x is %d", x);
	Return 0;
    }
     In the code void main needs to be int main and x is a float so inside  the printf %d needs to be %f.
