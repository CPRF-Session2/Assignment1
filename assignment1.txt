1.
A compiler is a program that transforms one computer programming language   
into another one. For example, you can use a compiler to change Python code into Assembly code.

2.
A compile error occurs when the code in a program is invalid. 
A runtime error occurs when the code is correct, but it can't be carried 
out.

a.
This is a compile error because there is a missing semicolon after the 2.

b.
This is a compile error because a variable cannot begin with a number.

c.
This is a runtime error because the code is correct, but the computer cannotdivide a number by 0.

3.There are three things wrong with this code. First of all, %d is for 
decimals, not floats. It should be changed to %f. Secondly, the "r" in 
"Return" should be lowercased. Finally, the code shouldn't have a return 
because the code is void.
